# New API endpoint!

Hey everyone! We're releasing a new API endpoint.. oh yeah, I have an API endpoint..

## API Endpoint for downloading journals

I kinda forgot to say anything about it earlier,
but we have an API endpoint for downloading journals.
You can find it at https://journal-limpet.com/api/integration/

The endpoints we have are:

- `/api/integration/info` - Gets your profile information with the info we have about your user.
- `/api/integration/all-journals/download` - Downloads all journals you have on your Journal Limpet account.
- `/api/integration/latest-journal/download` - Downloads the latest journal you have on your Journal Limpet account.
