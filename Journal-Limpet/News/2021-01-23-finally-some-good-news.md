## Finally some good news

We've added some new fancy things, like these news, with RSS and everything!

Oh yeah, you can grab the RSS at [$rssUrl$]($rssUrl$)!

.. and we also made sure so that the index page now tells you the truth,
if you actually are sending your journals to [EDDN](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN) or [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/).

And we have also added more safeguards, to make sure that your data is stored as it should!
