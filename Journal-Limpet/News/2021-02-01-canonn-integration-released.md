## Canonn R&D integration released into public

With the help of Commander LCU No Fool Like One of the [Canonn R&D](https://canonn.science)-team,
we have made an integration that helps Canonn collect events from our stored journals.

If you want to opt in to sending your `CodexEntry`, `SAASignalsFound` and `Docked` (for Hutton Orbital only)
to Canonn R&D, head over to your [settings](https://journal-limpet.com/Settings) and scroll all the way
to the bottom and enable the integration!

Safe journeys commanders! o7
