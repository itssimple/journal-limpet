# Journal Limpet / ED-Journals ![Continous integration](https://github.com/itssimple/journal-limpet/workflows/Continous%20integration/badge.svg?branch=master)

This project aims to store your (the player) journal logs from the game Elite: Dangerous,
with the ability to sync to different services and push to EDDN.

## Some planned features

- Local client for PC users, to have near instant upload of journals and other files used by other projects.
- Frontier auth as only method of login
- No need to keep a webpage open to get your journals, it happens in the background
- Ability to view/download every journal stored
- Sync to other systems (EDDN, and many more)
